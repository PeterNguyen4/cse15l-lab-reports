# Week 2 Lab Report 1
Hey incoming *CSE 15L* students! This report will explain how to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6`. As a little reminder, course-specific accounts allow us to gain remote access to computers over the Internet, which is a convenient way to do some work!


## Installing VScode
---
Even before working with remote access, we first need an IDE. Our class uses **Visual Studio Code** which you can download and install at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Once set up, an opened window of VScode should look like this:

![VScode](l1_1.png)

*Color themes and formatting may look different depending on settings*

* Note that you may be prompted to install an extension pack, which is recommended for better usability of VScode.


## Remotely Connecting
---
After [installing OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) **if on Windows** and finding your course-specific account for *CSE15L* through [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php), you are now ready to begin!

Enter the command `$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` in a newly opened a terminal in VSCode, replacing `zz` with the your the letters on your course-specific account.

* New terminal opened with Ctrl + `, or go to Terminal â†’ New Terminal on the menu
* You will likely be prompted with a lengthy message asking for a response, in which you should answer "yes" and continue to enter your password.

## Trying Some Commands
---
Try entering the following commands into the terminal to navigate through VScode:

* `cd`
* `ls`
* `pwd`
* `mkdir`
* `cp`

Here, I used `ls -a` to get a list of the directories as well as `cd .config` to change the directory to `.config`.

## Moving Files with `scp`
---
Create a file called `WhereAmI.java` with the following lines of code and run it with `javac` and `java`.

![Client](l1_4.png)

In the same terminal, run the command
`scp WhereAmI.java cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/`, enter the same password as with ssh, and log in once again with `ssh` but use `ls` to see the file's location on the server. Now you can run it remotely with `javac` and `java`!

## Setting and SSH Key
---
To log in without having to type our password, we first need to set up a key using `ssh-keygen`. Follow the prompts as seen below and a key should be generated.
![Private](l1_5.png)
* Note that I have already set up a key, so the terminal asks if I would like to override my previous one.

Next, copy the *public* key file (id_rsa.pub) to the server by first loggin into `ssh`, typing `mkdir .ssh`, exiting the server, and typing `scp /Users/<user-name>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your client.

* The message after `mkdir. ssh` should not appear in your terminal.
* Be sure to use your own username and course-specific account.

## Optimizing Remote Running
---
To best optimize, we can use semicolons to run multiple commands in the same line and the up-arrow to get the previous command. With this in mind, I was able to run the commands in two keystrokes.
![Optimizing](l1_6.png)
1. The first line copies the edited file from the client to the server.
2. The second line logs into the server (using a key), compiles, and runs the file.
